The biggest significance of this research project is demonstrating how intelligent transportation systems can be applied in Uganda.This project will also quicken the toll payment process for motorists eliminating the congestion from the queues and delays that arise from the current system.

Additionally,  the project is a step in the right direction towards achieving one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDG13, that is concerned with climate action\cite{united_nations_goal_2022} as paper wastage in printing tickets, and vehicle emissions as they wait in queues are both reduced significantly by the proposed solution.In the long run, such a system can be scaled to various parts of the country paving the way for development of smart cities in Uganda
