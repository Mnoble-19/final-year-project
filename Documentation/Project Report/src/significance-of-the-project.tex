In our project, we were able to develop a digital parking payment system. This system comprises a cross platform mobile application, and a low-cost ESP32 microcontroller for payment verification, eliminating the need for ticket usage when making the payments. This system we believe will address other challenges prevailing in the current system such as difficulty in accessing payment points, fraud by the gate attendants and the issue of hefty fines for ticket loss.
