    abstract = {Flutter is a popular UI framework for developing mobile applications by Google. It has caught traction in recent years. However, Flutter developers have to deal with a state management issue when developing their applications. In order to solve this problem, multiple architectures have been developed. This paper proposes a new Flutter architecture based on the Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob. The Flutter Clean Architecture proposed in this paper is packaged and released through a Flutter package. The architecture is tested by developing a full application from scratch using the package and documenting the process. The Flutter Clean Architecture provides a solution to the state management problem as well as a potential overall choice for Flutter mobile application architecture.},

In this pilot study, we swabbed circulating \$1 bills obtained from a New York City bank in February (Winter) and June (Summer) 2013 and used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to profile the communities found on their surface. Using basic culture conditions, we also tested whether viable microbes could be recovered from bills. Results Shotgun metagenomics identified eukaryotes as the most abundant sequences on money, followed by bacteria, viruses and archaea. Eukaryotic assemblages were dominated by human, other metazoan and fungal taxa. The currency investigated harbored a diverse microbial population that was dominated by human skin and oral commensals, including Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus. Other taxa detected not associated with humans included Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, microbes typically associated with dairy production and fermentation. Culturing results indicated that viable microbes can be isolated from paper currency. Conclusions We conducted the first metagenomic characterization of the surface of paper money in the United States, establishing a baseline for microbes found on \$1 bills circulating in New York City. Our results suggest that money amalgamates DNA from sources inhabiting the human microbiome, food, and other environmental inputs, some of which can be recovered as viable organisms. These monetary communities may be maintained through contact with human skin, and DNA obtained from money may provide a record of human behavior and health. Understanding these microbial profiles is especially relevant to public health as money could potentially mediate interpersonal transfer of microbes.},

However, the widespread adoption of mobile phones has enabled the development of mobile money systems that deliver financial services through the mobile phone network. Despite the success of mobile money, there is a lack of quantitative studies that unveil which factors contribute to the adoption and sustained usage of such services. In this paper, we describe the results of a quantitative study that analyzes data from the world's leading mobile money service, M-Pesa. We analyzed millions of anonymized mobile phone communications and M-Pesa transactions in an African country. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we analyze the customers' usage of M-Pesa and report large-scale patterns of behavior; (2) we present the results of applying machine learning models to predict mobile money adoption (AUC=0.691), and mobile money spending (AUC=0.619) using multiple data sources: mobile phone data, M-Pesa agent information, the number of M-Pesa friends in the user's social network, and the characterization of the user's geographic location; (3) we discuss the most predictive features in both models and draw key implications for the design of mobile money services in a developing country. We find that the most predictive features are related to mobile phone activity, to the presence of M-Pesa users in a customer's ego-network and to mobility. We believe that our work will contribute to the understanding of the factors playing a role in the adoption and sustained usage of mobile money services in developing economies.},

Novel experimental studies found aircraft noise to be associated with oxidative stress–induced vascular damage, mediated by activation of the NADPH oxidase, uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and vascular infiltration with inflammatory cells. Transcriptome analysis of aortic tissues from animals exposed to aircraft noise revealed changes in the expression of genes responsible for the regulation of vascular function, vascular remodeling, and cell death.

    abstract = {Background: 
 Residential proximity to road traffic is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality. It is unknown, however, whether changes in residential proximity to traffic could alter the risk of CHD mortality.
 Methods: 
 We used a population-based cohort study with a 5-year exposure period and a 4-year follow-up period to explore the association between changes in residential proximity to road traffic and the risk of CHD mortality. The cohort comprised all residents aged 45–85 years who resided in metropolitan Vancouver during the exposure period and without known CHD at baseline (n = 450,283). Residential proximity to traffic was estimated using a geographic information system. CHD deaths during the follow-up period were identified using provincial death registration database. The data were analyzed using logistic regression.
 Results: 
 Compared with the subjects consistently living away from road traffic ({\textgreater}150 m from a highway or {\textgreater}50 m from a major road) during the 9-year study period, those consistently living close to traffic (≤150 m from a highway or ≤50 m from a major road) had the greatest risk of CHD mortality (relative risk [RR] = 1.29 [95\% confidence interval = 1.18–1.41]). By comparison, those who moved closer to traffic during the exposure period had less increased risk than those who were consistently exposed (1.20 [1.00–1.43]), and those who moved away from traffic had even less increase in the risk (1.14 [0.95–1.37]). All analyses were adjusted for baseline age, sex, pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertensive heart disease), and neighborhood socioeconomic status.
 Conclusions: 
 Living close to major roadways was associated with increased risk of coronary mortality, whereas moving away from major roadways was associated with decreased risk.},

    abstract = {Congestion is a complicated problem that often occurs in big cities. Congestion occurs not only on arterial roads but also on toll roads. The impact of this traffic jam is extraordinary. According to data from the Ministry of National Development Planning of the Republic of Indonesia, in the State capital of Indonesia alone, the value of losses due to congestion every year reaches 65 trillion. In addition, a study found the fact that congestion also increases the risk of heart failure, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. Since 2017 the Indonesian Government through the regulation of the Ministry of Public Works has required electronic payment transactions on toll roads. The media used is an electronic toll card. By using this media, the vehicle must really stop at the Automatic Toll Gate to be able to tap the electronic toll card. But the relatively long reading time often actually adds to the traffic jam. This study aims to create a system with a GPS-based mobile application to reduce the toll queue payment at the Automatic Toll Gate through simulations using Vissim software. With Vissim software, an analysis of six simulation scenarios was carried out. The simulation results show that a GPS-based mobile application has succeeded in reducing the toll payment queue. In the ideal scenario of a small vehicle queue, there is an average queue reduction of 56.43\%, an average reduction of 68.99\% delay, a reduction in fuel use by 22.67\% and a reduction of CO2, NOx and PM10 exhaust gases respectively amounted to 46.21\%, 64.39\% and 63.45\%.},

    abstract = {Toll plaza operations in India are entirely different from that of the United States (US) and European countries. The majority of tollbooths in India are manually operated, where all the vehicles arriving at the toll plaza have to stop at tollbooth to pay the toll. During this process, a vehicle first decelerates, joins the queue and pays the toll at tollbooths. Afterwards, the vehicle accelerates and regains the stream speed. The overall process causes delay to each approaching vehicle due to deceleration, waiting time in the queue, service time at the tollbooth and finally due to acceleration. Hence, the present study aims to quantify the overall delay that includes system delay (service time and waiting time), acceleration and deceleration delays at manually operated toll plazas under mixed traffic conditions. The overall delay model has been proposed by using (i) dynamic acceleration and deceleration values, (ii) waiting time in the queue and (iii) service time depends upon traffic composition and approach volume. The delay thus obtained from models has been validated from field observed delay values and it is found that no significant difference between observed and predicted delay values. Therefore, the proposed delay model can be used in future to quantify the vehicle delay at toll plazas and can also propose Level of Service (LoS) thresholds and the number of tollbooths required for prescribed LoS.},

In addition to its documentation of the Object Modeling Technique (OMT), a graphical notation for depicting object-oriented systems, Object-Oriented Modeling and Design does a first-rate job of explaining basic and advanced object-orientation concepts. The book then moves on to explain the authors' techniques for breaking down problems into components and figuring out systems of interrelated objects that can be used as designs for programs. Interestingly, the authors devote part of their book to implementing object-oriented solutions in non-object-oriented languages--mainly C, Ada, and Fortran.

Cities in the developing world have not been spared from the congestion problems due to the influx of vehicles and the subsequent increase in private vehicle ownership. Congestion in developing countries is also associated with limited road infrastructure and lack of traffic management resources. Poor traffic management leads to inconvenience as it is characterized by an increase in travel time. The study evaluates congestion in Gaborone as experienced and perceived by regular travellers, using both public and private transportation in Gaborone. The objective of this paper is to investigate the state of road transportation congestion by assessing road user perceptions on travelling times and delays as well as investigating private transportation users’ possibilities of migrating to public transportation use with the influence of ICT. To achieve this, we evaluate individuals travel times, develop regression models predicting total trip duration for an individuals’ trips per day as well as exploring travellers’ experiences with the public transportation system and their understanding of sustainability in relation to increased private vehicle use. The study further evaluates factors that could influence modal shift from private to public transportation as a way of reducing vehicles on the roads.},

This concept has been implemented with the use of strain gauge load cell to determine the vehicles weight and accordingly defining the vehicles type. The load cell has been interfaced with Arduino Mega 2560 which will determine the toll tax of the vehicles. The smart card reader ACR122U NFC reader has also been interfaced with Arduino Mega 2560 to debit the appropriate toll tax for the specific vehicle type. The optical character recognition (OCR) system has also been used as a primary surveillance system which plays a key role in helping the enforcement department for vehicle licence plate identification. This ETC system will be a state of the art technology for the areas with high traffic in toll plaza by omitting long queues and fuel wastage for the users and also reducing human error.},

The proposed system aims to make a digital toll collection system which can eliminate the delay on toll roads, toll bridges and toll tunnel without cash and without requiring cars to stop. This paper focuses on an electronic toll collection system which uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to identify a vehicle specifically for collecting toll. The proposed RFID system uses tags that are mounted on the digital number plate of the vehicles, through which information embedded on the tags are read by RFID readers. It is possible to reduce the need for vehicle owners and toll collection authorities to distribute tickets and collect tolls manually in this system Information on the toll payment can also be easily exchanged between the vehicle owners and toll authorities. As a result, transparency in toll payment can be ensured with reduced manual labor and human errors. Thus, building smart transportation system will become easier.},

This process may take few minutes to pass the toll system. In order to decrease this passing time, we decided to automate the process of toll system by doing technology enablement of Internet of Things (IoT). This work would reduce the manual work and hence would make the passing of the vehicles much faster as compared to traditional toll system.Every vehicle is tagged with a RFID tag, which has vehicle's registration number in it, which can be sensed by RFID reader present at tollbooth.RFID reader will send this information to IoT controller (Arduino). Sensed registration number can looked in to cloud database for getting wallet balance and if sufficient balance is there, and then toll charges can be deducted automatically. While rider can enjoy pause free ride and will be intimated about his trip deduction charges. For interaction of client a mobile app will also be designed with which client can track all logs of payments and can add money in wallet using the app. The sole purpose of this paper is to reduce the hardships caused by manual toll collection system and it assures time saving, fuel conservation and contributing in saving of money by making process automatic.},

    abstract = {Nowadays almost all highways toll plazas are manually operated, where an operator collects cash from the driver and provides a receipt. Since this procedure can be slow, we often encounter traffic jams at the toll plazas on busy highways. Automatic process of toll collection will save time, effort, and man power. In this work propose a low cost and efficient technique called Electronic Toll Collection using RFID modules that automatically collects the toll from moving vehicles when they cross the toll plaza. We also assume that an owner maintains a prepaid account, so that toll tax is deducted automatically from the driver's account at toll plaza. If the balance in the owner's account is low or if the vehicle is not equipped with an RF system, the toll gate remains close. In such a case vehicle owner will have to pay the toll tax in cash and collect the receipt. The owner receives an SMS message on his/she mobile about the details of the payment and there is no need for him to stop the vehicle. How many vehicles passing through the toll gate stored in a database. We can also find out a vehicle how many times passing through the toll gate in a day. Through this process of toll collection will save time, effort and man power.},

    abstract = {Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality, and recent studies have shown excess morbidity and mortality for drivers, commuters and individuals living near major roadways. Presently, our understanding of the air pollution impacts from congestion on roads is very limited. This study demonstrates an approach to characterize risks of traffic for on- and near-road populations. Simulation modeling was used to estimate on- and near-road NO2 concentrations and health risks for freeway and arterial scenarios attributable to traffic for different traffic volumes during rush hour periods. The modeling used emission factors from two different models (Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model and Motor Vehicle Emissions Factor Model version 6.2), an empirical traffic speed–volume relationship, the California Line Source Dispersion Model, an empirical NO2–NOx relationship, estimated travel time changes during congestion, and concentration–response relationships from the literature, which give emergency doctor visits, hospital admissions and mortality attributed to NO2 exposure. An incremental analysis, which expresses the change in health risks for small increases in traffic volume, showed non-linear effects. For a freeway, “U” shaped trends of incremental risks were predicted for on-road populations, and incremental risks are flat at low traffic volumes for near-road populations. For an arterial road, incremental risks increased sharply for both on- and near-road populations as traffic increased. These patterns result from changes in emission factors, the NO2–NOx relationship, the travel delay for the on-road population, and the extended duration of rush hour for the near-road population. This study suggests that health risks from congestion are potentially significant, and that additional traffic can significantly increase risks, depending on the type of road and other factors. Further, evaluations of risk associated with congestion must consider travel time, the duration of rush-hour, congestion-specific emission estimates, and uncertainties.},

Based on the exogenous infrastructure change of a county highway opening as a natural experiment, this paper uses the spatial difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze the impact of highway construction in three different provinces of China from 2004 to 2017. It was proved that highway connectivity had no significant or negative impact on the economy of the counties in three provinces that the highway passes through. In addition, highway connectivity was claimed to have obvious spatial spillover effects, which could promote the economic development of the whole region. For counties belonging to provinces in different regions and stages of economic development, we establish a spatial DID model that integrates time and space dimensions to study the impact of expressways on county economic development, to make up for the traditional DID model’s dependence on SUTVA assumptions, and to obtain spatial spillover effects.},

The development of discrete choice models (multinomial logit and ordered logit) allows the individual effects of income, household size, and location variables to be disentangled. Results showed that income had the greatest impact on car ownership, with an aggregate-level elasticity between 0.908 and 1.110 in 1995. At the same time, the impact of other variables was relatively low, because income was a major limitation to car ownership. Analysis of behavioral changes in both years showed that distance to work had a negative effect on car ownership in 1995 but a positive effect in 2005; this result suggests an interesting area for further research. Additionally, population density was found to have a negative effect in 1995 but no effect in 2005; this change indicates an uncertain role for densification strategies to reduce car ownership. Finally, a higher quality of public transportation was found to have a generally negative effect on car ownership.},

    abstract = {Background
The relationship between transport infrastructure and economic growth has remained one of the most striking expanses from the perspectives of economists, researchers as well as policy makers. This paper therefore has examined the impact of road transport infrastructure investment on Uganda's economic performance and also quantified the economic costs associated with inefficient urban road transport infrastructure network for the case of Uganda. The paper utilizes a rich econometric methodology involving the Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) to estimate the impact of road transport infrastructure and economic growth as well as traffic counts of travel East bound (EB) and West Bound (WB) for the major roads leading to Kampala Capital City to estimate the generalized cost of travel as the city represents more than 70\% of the total national vehicle traffic/population. The quantification of gains and costs provided a benchmark to inform further policy processes, planning, and feasibility studies.
Results
The ARDL bound test results confirmed the existence cointegration of variables although the variables were integrated of different orders. The results of empirical ARDL indicated that investment in road transport infrastructure has both short and long run significant impact on economic growth of Uganda. In the long run, the study finds that investment in road transport infrastructure has a positive and significant impact on economic growth. But in the short run, the impact is actually negative. The paper finds that, a 1 percentage point increase in investment in road transport infrastructure increases economic growth by 0.062 percentage points in the long run. On the other hand, a 1 percentage point increase in investment in road transport infrastructure reduces economic growth in the 1st year of the increase in the expenditure by 0.089 percentage points but (Gross Domestic Product) GDP increases by 7.5 percentage points in the second year. This implies that, the impact of road transport infrastructure investment on economic growth occurs with lags for the case of Uganda. Evidence also justifies presence of significant economic benefits due to massive investments in the urban transport infrastructure network through express highways and associated roads especially within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area, municipal authorities and future transport planning for new cities.
Conclusion
The main conclusion of this paper is that, with the current state of traffic flow, the country loses about 6.7\% of its GDP due to traffic congestion annually. Therefore, projects such as; Kampala flyover project, Entebbe Express Highway, Southern Bypass, Northern Bypass, Kampala Bombo Express Highway, Kampala Jinja Express Highway and Kibuye Mpigi Express highway together with associated urban roads improvements that are planned for seamless flow of traffic within the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA) are highly justified. These projects should be prioritized, fast-tracked and developed in a concurrent manner to realize the intended results. Further, the negative short run impact of infrastructure spending on growth implies the need to rebalance public spending to also prioritize social sectors.},
