The challenges mentioned in the problem statement above affect various parking payment points in the country and even beyond Uganda's borders. However, for this project we focused on Makerere University's main gates. The team developed the mobile application, programmed the microcontroller to read the QR code values and open the gate. To demonstrate the gate-opening logic, we used a Servo Motor equipment
