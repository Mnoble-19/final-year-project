\subsection{Main Objective}
To design and implement a novel system that consists of a mobile app and an embedded microcontroller for cashless parking payment at Makerere University using QR code technology and local popular payment platforms such as MTN Mobile Money. The system aims to provide a more convenient, efficient, and transparent way of managing toll payments in the university context, and to overcome the problems and limitations of the current system of ticketing and payme
