\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This chapter shows screenshots of the system interface, connections of the hardware equipment and other details the programming environment that was used to develop the system.


\section{Implementing the system}

\subsection{Programming Tools}
The system was implemented using the following programming tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Android Studio}: This is the official IDE for Android development. It was used in the development of the mobile application.
    \item \textbf{Arduino IDE}: This is the official IDE for Arduino development. It was used in the development of the microcontroller code.
    \item \textbf{Digital Ocean}: This is a cloud hosting service. It was used to host the remote server.
    \item \textbf{Flutter}: This is a cross-platform UI toolkit developed by Google. It is used to develop the mobile application.
    \item \textbf{Firebase}: This is a mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. It is used to handle user authentication.
    \item \textbf{Silicon Pay}: This is the payment gateway the researchers opted for due to its support for all local payment platforms
    \item \textbf{ESP32 Microcontroller}: This is a microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems. It is used to receive data from the mobile application and send it to the remote server.
    \item \textbf{Servo Motor}: This consists of a DC motor, gearbox, and a control circuit. It has a simple lever that can be attached to it and used to demonstrate the opening and closing of the gate upon verification of payment.
    \item \textbf{FTDI connector}: This is a USB to serial adapter that is used to program the ESP32 microcontroller.
