Managing access to parking places is a common challenge in many urban public places such as universities, malls where there is a high demand for parking spaces and a limited availability\cite{parmar_study_2020}.Effective management is crucial for ensuring the smooth flow of traffic, reducing congestion and pollution, and generating revenue for the university.
However, the current system of ticketing and payment for parking at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, suffers from several problems, such as frequent malfunction of the ticketing machines, fraud by the system employees, difficulty in locating a payment point for motorists, and hefty fines for lost tickets.

These problems result in inconvenience, inefficiency, and revenue loss for both the systemâ€™s managers and motorists, thus there is a need for developing a novel system that can provide a more convenient, efficient, and transparent way of managing these payments in the university context.
