Managing access to parking places is a common challenge in many urban public places such as universities, malls where there is a high demand for parking spaces but limited availability\cite{parmar_study_2020}.
The current system of ticketing and payment for parking at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda was put in place to address the above challenge. From our interviews with Mr. Twinomusinguzi Julius, the project manager, we were able to determine that it has however suffered from several problems, such as frequent malfunction of the ticketing machines, fraud by the system employees, difficulty in locating a payment point for motorists, and hefty fines for lost tickets.

These problems result in inconvenience, inefficiency, and revenue loss for both the systemâ€™s managers and motorists, thus there is a need for developing a cross platform system that can provide a simpler, and more transparent way of managing these payments in the university context.
