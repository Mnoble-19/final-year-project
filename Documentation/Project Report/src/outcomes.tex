The project achieve the following outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Informative results on testing and evaluating the current payment system used at toll gates in comparison to the new proposed system
    \item A well developed and operational cross-platform mobile application to enable payment of toll fees as well as verification of the payments. This application is available for both iOS and Android mobile platforms
    \item A functional embedded QR Code scanner that's able to capture QR code values and verify payments that have been made.

\end{itemize}


\section{Project Gaps and Future Works}
Currently, implementation of the project is limited to the university scope and only accounts for users with smartphones with iOS and Android Operating Systems.

This project can easily be scaled to various places such as malls and hospitals, and extended to account for non-smartphone users.
