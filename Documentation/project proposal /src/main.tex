    \begin{abstract}
        Traffic congestion is a major issue in many developing world cities, including Kampala, due to limited infrastructure and traffic management resources. Governments in these regions have attempted to address this issue by constructing toll express highways as part of embracing intelligent transportation systems. However, this approach has led to challenges,such as long queues and delays at tollgates.One proposed solution is the use of RFID technology,but this approach is cost-prohibitive.

        This research proposes a low-cost solution tailored to the local context of Uganda. The proposed solution leverages techniques from the field of ubiquitous computing where a secure, reliable mobile application for prepaid payment of toll fees. These payments are recorded and in a cloud server and can be verified using a linked embedded QR code scanner. The proposed system can serve as an example of how intelligent transportation systems can be implemented in a developing city like Kampala, utilizing techniques from the field of ubiquitous computing. In the long run, such a project could help Kampala evolve into a smart city that is clean and self-sustaining.
