\subsection{Main Objective}
To develop a low-cost secure reliable system, based on ubiquitous computing and mobile commerce techniques, as a component of a larger intelligent transportation system mainly used to simplify and quicken payment of toll fees.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
The project's specific objectives include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To understand the existing payment approach used at Makerere University toll gates.
    \item To design a system prototype for the proposed solution.
    \item To implement the proposed mobile application and confirm whether it solves the highlighted problems within the current payment system.
    \item To demonstrate how embedded QR code scanners can be used in the toll payment context as an alternative to long range RFID scanners in low-resource settings
\end{itemize}
